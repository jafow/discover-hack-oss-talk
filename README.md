# Discover hacking open source talk
This is a repo to hold slides & notes from a talk about
exploring unfamiliar open source projects.

## Usage
The slides are made out-of-the box with the very nice tool
[remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

To run the rendered slides just clone this repo and open the `slides.html` file
in your favorite web browser.

For example:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jafow/discover-hacking-oss-talk.git ~/Desktop
$ cd ~/Desktop/disover-hacking-oss-talk
$ firefox slides.html
```
