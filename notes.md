talk covering methods for hacking on an unfamiliar open source codebase.

## TOC

1. What are we doing and why?

2. Find a project 

3. Find an entry point

4. Build something (or fix something!)

## What are we doing & why?

*   discussing methods, techniques, and tools for diving into unfamiliar
waters

*   bring up obstacles and ways around them

*   why? OSS is a great way to learn a lot very quickly

*   it can serve as a proxy for 'on the job' software training
    (exposure to coding patterns, git, new technologies/syntax etc)

*   could even be a worthy addition to the resume
*   it feels good!

## Find a project
If you're lucky you already know of a project you're excited about.
Congrats!

If you don't what can you do?
*   be strategic: choose a popular/trendy project
    downsides: can be harder to get a meaningful commit in there.
    *   choose a technology that a company you want to work at uses.    

*   use the awesome projects curated on github
